# 🧠 Skin Cancer SQL Capstone Project

This project explores skin cancer data using SQL, with a focus on identifying lesion types, high-risk demographics, and symptoms related to biopsy-confirmed cancers. It was completed using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4.

## 📋 Key Insights

- **Most common lesion**: ACK (461 cases)
- **Highest risk symptoms**: Elevated (344), Itchy (326), Grew (294)
- **Most biopsied group**: Female, non-smoker, pesticide-exposed (Pomerania background)
- **Most affected region**: Face (278 lesions)
- **Largest average lesion size**: MEL (14.09 mm)

## 📁 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_tables.sql` | SQL to create the database tables |
| `join_tables.sql` | SQL to join patient and lesion data |
| `lesion_analysis.sql` | SQL queries for analysis |
| `ml_ready_view.sql` | SQL view for ML-ready dataset |
| `Skin_Cancer_SQL_Project_with_Insights.pptx` | PowerPoint presentation of findings |

## 📌 Recommendations

- Target lesions with elevated, itchy, and growth symptoms for early screening
- Focus education on exposed regions (e.g., face, arms)
- Use generated view for machine learning predictions

## 🛠 Tools Used

- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4
- GitHub
